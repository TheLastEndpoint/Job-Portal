<h2>📌 Project Overview</h2>
<p>
The <b>Job Portal Web Application</b> is designed to streamline the recruitment process by providing a centralized platform
where recruiters can manage job postings and applications, while job seekers can search, apply, and track jobs efficiently.
The system emphasizes secure authentication, role-based access, and optimized data handling.

<h2>❓ Problem Statement</h2>
<p>
Traditional hiring processes often lack transparency, proper tracking, and efficient communication between recruiters and
job seekers. Recruiters face difficulties managing multiple applicants, while job seekers struggle to filter and track
relevant opportunities. This application solves these issues by offering a secure, role-based job portal with structured
data management.
